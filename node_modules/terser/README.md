A JavaScript mangler/compressor toolkit for ES6+.

*note*: <s>You can support this project on patreon: [link]</s> **The Terser Patreon is shutting down in favor of opencollective**. Check out [PATRONS.md](https://github.com/terser/terser/blob/master/PATRONS.md) for our first-tier patrons.

Terser recommends you use RollupJS to bundle your modules, as that produces smaller code overall.

*Beautification* has been undocumented and is *being removed* from terser, we recommend you use [prettier](https://npmjs.com/package/prettier).

Why choose terser?
------------------

`uglify-es` is [no longer maintained](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/3156#issuecomment-392943058) and `uglify-js` does not support ES6+.

**`terser`** is a fork of `uglify-es` that mostly retains API and CLI compatibility
with `uglify-es` and `uglify-js@3`.
=======
UglifyJS 2
==========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/mishoo/UglifyJS2)

UglifyJS is a JavaScript parser, minifier, compressor or beautifier toolkit.

This page documents the command line utility.  For
[API and internals documentation see my website](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/).
There's also an
[in-browser online demo](http://lisperator.net/uglifyjs/#demo) (for Firefox,
Chrome and probably Safari).

Install
-------

First make sure you have installed the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
(You may need to restart your computer after this step).

From NPM for use as a command line app:

    npm install terser -g

From NPM for programmatic use:

    npm install terser

From Git:

    git clone git://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2.git
    cd UglifyJS2
    npm link .

Usage
-----

<!-- CLI_USAGE:START -->

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
    terser [input files] [options]

Terser can take multiple input files.  It's recommended that you pass the
input files first, then pass the options.  Terser will parse input files

in sequence and apply any compression options.  The files are parsed in the
same global scope, that is, a reference from a file to some
variable/function declared in another file will be matched properly.

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
Command line arguments that take options (like --parse, --compress, --mangle and
--format) can take in a comma-separated list of default option overrides. For
instance:

    terser input.js --compress ecma=2015,computed_props=false

If no input file is specified, Terser will read from STDIN.
=======
If you want to read from STDIN instead, pass a single dash instead of input
files.
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

If you wish to pass your options before the input files, separate the two with
a double dash to prevent input files being used as option arguments:

    terser --compress --mangle -- input.js

The available options are:

```

                                               `strict` disables quoted properties
                                               being automatically reserved.
                                `regex`  Only mangle matched property names.

                                            example for licensing information.
                                            This will not be parsed, but the source
                                            map will adjust for its presence.
                                `quote_style`  Quote style:
                                               0 - auto

                                             want to disable `negate_iife` under
                                             compressor options.
                                `wrap_func_args`  Wrap function arguments in parenthesis.
    -o, --output <file>         Output file path (default STDOUT). Specify `ast` or

                                sourceMappingURL.  Defaults to the value passed
                                with --source-map.
  --source-map-include-sources  Pass this flag if you want to include the
                                content of source files in the source map as
                                sourcesContent property.

                                code.
  --screw-ie8                   Use this flag if you don't wish to support
                                Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks.
                                By default UglifyJS will not try to be IE-proof.
  --support-ie8                 Use this flag to support Internet Explorer 6-8 quirks.
                                Note: may break standards compliant `catch` identifiers.
  --expr                        Parse a single expression, rather than a
                                program (for parsing JSON)

                                in source maps. For example -p 3 will drop 3
                                directories from file names and ensure they are
                                relative paths. You can also specify -p
                                relative, which will make UglifyJS figure out
                                itself the relative paths between original
                                sources, the source map and the output file.
  -o, --output                  Output file (default STDOUT).
  -b, --beautify                Beautify output/specify output options.
  -m, --mangle                  Mangle names/pass mangler options.
  -r, --reserved                Reserved names to exclude from mangling.
  -c, --compress                Enable compressor/pass compressor options. Pass
                                options like -c
                                hoist_vars=false,if_return=false. Use -c with
                                no argument to use the default compression
                                options.
  -d, --define                  Global definitions
  -e, --enclose                 Embed everything in a big function, with a
                                configurable parameter/argument list.

                                default this works like Google Closure, keeping
                                JSDoc-style comments that contain e.g. "@license",
                                or start with "!". You can optionally pass one of the
                                following arguments to this flag:
                                - "all" to keep all comments
                                - `false` to omit comments in the output
                                - a valid JS RegExp like `/foo/` or `/^!/` to
                                keep only matching comments.
                                Note that currently not *all* comments can be
                                kept when compression is on, because of dead
                                code removal or cascading statements into
                                sequences.

    --ecma <version>            Specify ECMAScript release: 5, 2015, 2016, etc.
    -e, --enclose [arg[:value]] Embed output in a big function with configurable
                                arguments and values.
    --ie8                       Support non-standard Internet Explorer 8.
                                Equivalent to setting `ie8: true` in `minify()`
                                for `compress`, `mangle` and `format` options.
                                By default Terser will not try to be IE-proof.
    --keep-classnames           Do not mangle/drop class names.
    --keep-fnames               Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for

    --module                    Input is an ES6 module. If `compress` or `mangle` is
                                enabled then the `toplevel` option will be enabled.
    --name-cache <file>         File to hold mangled name mappings.
    --safari10                  Support non-standard Safari 10/11.

                                for `mangle` and `format` options.
                                By default `terser` will not work around
                                Safari 10/11 bugs.
    --source-map [options]      Enable source map/specify source map options:
                                `base`  Path to compute relative paths from input files.
                                `content`  Input source map, useful if you're compressing
                                           JS that was generated from some other original
                                           code. Specify "inline" if the source map is
                                           included within the sources.
                                `filename`  Name and/or location of the output source.
                                `includeSources`  Pass this flag if you want to include
                                                  the content of source files in the
                                                  source map as sourcesContent property.
                                `root`  Path to the original source to be included in
                                        the source map.
                                `url`  If specified, path to the source map to append in

                                licensing information.  This will not be
                                parsed, but the source map will adjust for its
                                presence.
  --stats                       Display operations run time on STDERR.
  --acorn                       Use Acorn for parsing.

                                when included in, say, a browser.
  --export-all                  Only used when --wrap, this tells UglifyJS to
                                add code to automatically export all globals.
  --lint                        Display some scope warnings

                                may be anonymous function wrapped (IIFE) by the
                                .user.js engine `caller`.
  --keep-fnames                 Do not mangle/drop function names.  Useful for
                                code relying on Function.prototype.name.
  --reserved-file               File containing reserved names
  --reserve-domprops            Make (most?) DOM properties reserved for
                                --mangle-props
  --mangle-props                Mangle property names (default `0`). Set to
                                `true` or `1` to mangle all property names. Set
                                to `unquoted` or `2` to only mangle unquoted
                                property names. Mode `2` also enables the
                                `keep_quoted_props` beautifier option to
                                preserve the quotes around property names and
                                disables the `properties` compressor option to
                                prevent rewriting quoted properties with dot
                                notation. You can override these by setting
                                them explicitly on the command line.
  --mangle-regex                Only mangle property names matching the regex
  --name-cache                  File to hold mangled names mappings
  --pure-funcs                  List of functions that can be safely removed if
                                their return value is not used           [array]
```

Specify `--output` (`-o`) to declare the output file.  Otherwise the output
goes to STDOUT.

## Source map options

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
Terser can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
=======
UglifyJS2 can generate a source map file, which is highly useful for
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
debugging your compressed JavaScript.  To get a source map, pass
`--source-map output.js.map` (full path to the file where you want the
source map dumped).

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
Additional options:

- `--source-map "filename='<NAME>'"` to specify the name of the source map.

- `--source-map "root='<URL>'"` to pass the URL where the original files can be found.

- `--source-map "url='<URL>'"` to specify the URL where the source map can be found.
  Otherwise Terser assumes HTTP `X-SourceMap` is being used and will omit the
  `//# sourceMappingURL=` directive.

For example:

    terser js/file1.js js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js -c -m \
             --source-map "root='http://foo.com/src',url='foo.min.js.map'"
=======
Additionally you might need `--source-map-root` to pass the URL where the
original files can be found.  In case you are passing full paths to input
files to UglifyJS, you can use `--prefix` (`-p`) to specify the number of
directories to drop from the path prefix when declaring files in the source
map.

For example:

    uglifyjs /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file1.js \
             /home/doe/work/foo/src/js/file2.js \
             -o foo.min.js \
             --source-map foo.min.js.map \
             --source-map-root http://foo.com/src \
             -p 5 -c -m
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

The above will compress and mangle `file1.js` and `file2.js`, will drop the
output in `foo.min.js` and the source map in `foo.min.js.map`.  The source
mapping will refer to `http://foo.com/src/js/file1.js` and
`http://foo.com/src/js/file2.js` (in fact it will list `http://foo.com/src`
as the source map root, and the original files as `js/file1.js` and
`js/file2.js`).

### Composed source map

When you're compressing JS code that was output by a compiler such as
CoffeeScript, mapping to the JS code won't be too helpful.  Instead, you'd
like to map back to the original code (i.e. CoffeeScript).  Terser has an
option to take an input source map.  Assuming you have a mapping from
CoffeeScript → compiled JS, Terser can generate a map from CoffeeScript →
compressed JS by mapping every token in the compiled JS to its original
location.

To use this feature you need to pass `--in-source-map
/path/to/input/source.map`.  Normally the input source map should also point
to the file containing the generated JS, so if that's correct you can omit
input files from the command line.

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
## CLI compress options

You need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally
you can pass a comma-separated list of [compress options](#compress-options).

Options are in the form `foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies
a boolean option that you want to set `true`; it's effectively a
shortcut for `foo=true`).

Example:

    terser file.js -c toplevel,sequences=false

## CLI mangle options
=======
## Mangler options
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

To enable the mangler you need to pass `--mangle` (`-m`).  The following
(comma-separated) options are supported:

- `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

- `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where `eval` or `with` are used
  (disabled by default).

When mangling is enabled but you want to prevent certain names from being
mangled, you can declare those names with `--reserved` (`-r`) — pass a
comma-separated list of names.  For example:

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
    terser ... -m reserved=['$','require','exports']
=======
    uglifyjs ... -m -r '$,require,exports'
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

to prevent the `require`, `exports` and `$` names from being changed.

### Mangling property names (`--mangle-props`)

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
**Note:** THIS **WILL** BREAK YOUR CODE. A good rule of thumb is not to use this unless you know exactly what you're doing and how this works and read this section until the end.

Mangling property names is a separate step, different from variable name mangling.  Pass
`--mangle-props` to enable it. The least dangerous
way to use this is to use the `regex` option like so:

```
terser example.js -c -m --mangle-props regex=/_$/
```

This will mangle all properties that end with an
underscore. So you can use it to mangle internal methods.

By default, it will mangle all properties in the
input code with the exception of built in DOM properties and properties
in core JavaScript classes, which is what will break your code if you don't:

1. Control all the code you're mangling
2. Avoid using a module bundler, as they usually will call Terser on each file individually, making it impossible to pass mangled objects between modules.
3. Avoid calling functions like `defineProperty` or `hasOwnProperty`, because they refer to object properties using strings and will break your code if you don't know what you are doing.

An example:
=======
**Note:** this will probably break your code.  Mangling property names is a
separate step, different from variable name mangling.  Pass
`--mangle-props`.  It will mangle all properties that are seen in some
object literal, or that are assigned to.  For example:
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

```js
var x = {
  foo: 1
};
<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
x.bar_ = 2;
x["baz_"] = 3;
console.log(x.calc());
```
Mangle all properties (except for JavaScript `builtins`) (**very** unsafe):
```bash
$ terser example.js -c passes=2 -m --mangle-props
```
```javascript
var x={o:3,t:1,i:function(){return this.t+this.o},s:2};console.log(x.i());
```
Mangle all properties except for `reserved` properties (still very unsafe):
```bash
$ terser example.js -c passes=2 -m --mangle-props reserved=[foo_,bar_]
```
```javascript
var x={o:3,foo_:1,t:function(){return this.foo_+this.o},bar_:2};console.log(x.t());
```
Mangle all properties matching a `regex` (not as unsafe but still unsafe):
```bash
$ terser example.js -c passes=2 -m --mangle-props regex=/_$/
```
```javascript
var x={o:3,t:1,calc:function(){return this.t+this.o},i:2};console.log(x.calc());
```

Combining mangle properties options:
```bash
$ terser example.js -c passes=2 -m --mangle-props regex=/_$/,reserved=[bar_]
```
```javascript
var x={o:3,t:1,calc:function(){return this.t+this.o},bar_:2};console.log(x.calc());
```

In order for this to be of any use, we avoid mangling standard JS names and DOM
API properties by default (`--mangle-props builtins` to override).
=======

x.bar = 2;
x["baz"] = 3;
x[condition ? "moo" : "boo"] = 4;
console.log(x.something());
```

In the above code, `foo`, `bar`, `baz`, `moo` and `boo` will be replaced
with single characters, while `something()` will be left as is.

In order for this to be of any use, we should avoid mangling standard JS
names.  For instance, if your code would contain `x.length = 10`, then
`length` becomes a candidate for mangling and it will be mangled throughout
the code, regardless if it's being used as part of your own objects or
accessing an array's length.  To avoid that, you can use `--reserved-file`
to pass a filename that should contain the names to be excluded from
mangling.  This file can be used both for excluding variable names and
property names.  It could look like this, for example:

```js
{
  "vars": [ "define", "require", ... ],
  "props": [ "length", "prototype", ... ]
}
```

`--reserved-file` can be an array of file names (either a single
comma-separated argument, or you can pass multiple `--reserved-file`
arguments) — in this case it will exclude names from all those files.

A default exclusion file is provided in `tools/domprops.json` which should
cover most standard JS and DOM properties defined in various browsers.  Pass
`--reserve-domprops` to read that in.
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

You can also use a regular expression to define which property names should be
mangled.  For example, `--mangle-regex="/^_/"` will only mangle property names
that start with an underscore.

When you compress multiple files using this option, in order for them to
work together in the end we need to ensure somehow that one property gets
<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
mangled to the same name in all of them.  For this, pass `--name-cache filename.json`
and Terser will maintain these mappings in a file which can then be reused.
It should be initially empty.  Example:

```bash
$ rm -f /tmp/cache.json  # start fresh
$ terser file1.js file2.js --mangle-props --name-cache /tmp/cache.json -o part1.js
$ terser file3.js file4.js --mangle-props --name-cache /tmp/cache.json -o part2.js
=======
mangled to the same name in all of them.  For this, pass `--name-cache
filename.json` and UglifyJS will maintain these mappings in a file which can
then be reused.  It should be initially empty.  Example:

```
rm -f /tmp/cache.json  # start fresh
uglifyjs file1.js file2.js --mangle-props --name-cache /tmp/cache.json -o part1.js
uglifyjs file3.js file4.js --mangle-props --name-cache /tmp/cache.json -o part2.js
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
```

Now, `part1.js` and `part2.js` will be consistent with each other in terms
of mangled property names.

Using the name cache is not necessary if you compress all your files in a
single call to Terser.

#### Debugging property name mangling

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
Using quoted property name (`o["foo"]`) reserves the property name (`foo`)
so that it is not mangled throughout the entire script even when used in an
unquoted style (`o.foo`). Example:

```javascript
// stuff.js
var o = {
    "foo": 1,
    bar: 3
};
o.foo += o.bar;
console.log(o.foo);
```
```bash
$ terser stuff.js --mangle-props keep_quoted -c -m
```
```javascript
var o={foo:1,o:3};o.foo+=o.o,console.log(o.foo);
```

### Debugging property name mangling

You can also pass `--mangle-props debug` in order to mangle property names
=======
You can also pass `--mangle-props-debug` in order to mangle property names
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
without completely obscuring them. For example the property `o.foo`
would mangle to `o._$foo$_` with this option. This allows property mangling
of a large codebase while still being able to debug the code and identify
where mangling is breaking things.

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
```bash
$ terser stuff.js --mangle-props debug -c -m
```
```javascript
var o={_$foo$_:1,_$bar$_:3};o._$foo$_+=o._$bar$_,console.log(o._$foo$_);
```

You can also pass a custom suffix using `--mangle-props debug=XYZ`. This would then
=======
You can also pass a custom suffix using `--mangle-props-debug=XYZ`. This would then
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
mangle `o.foo` to `o._$foo$XYZ_`. You can change this each time you compile a
script to identify how a property got mangled. One technique is to pass a
random number on every compile to simulate mangling changing with different
inputs (e.g. as you update the input script with new properties), and to help
identify mistakes like writing mangled keys to storage.

<!-- CLI_USAGE:END -->
=======
## Compressor options
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

You need to pass `--compress` (`-c`) to enable the compressor.  Optionally
you can pass a comma-separated list of options.  Options are in the form
`foo=bar`, or just `foo` (the latter implies a boolean option that you want
to set `true`; it's effectively a shortcut for `foo=true`).

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
<!-- API_REFERENCE:START -->

Assuming installation via NPM, you can load Terser in your application
like this:

```javascript
const { minify } = require("terser");
```

Or,

```javascript
import { minify } from "terser";
```

Browser loading is also supported:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/source-map@0.7.3/dist/source-map.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/terser/dist/bundle.min.js"></script>
```

There is a single async high level function, **`async minify(code, options)`**,
which will perform all minification [phases](#minify-options) in a configurable
manner. By default `minify()` will enable [`compress`](#compress-options)
and [`mangle`](#mangle-options). Example:
```javascript
var code = "function add(first, second) { return first + second; }";
var result = await minify(code, { sourceMap: true });
console.log(result.code);  // minified output: function add(n,d){return n+d}
console.log(result.map);  // source map
```

You can `minify` more than one JavaScript file at a time by using an object
for the first argument where the keys are file names and the values are source
code:
```javascript
var code = {
    "file1.js": "function add(first, second) { return first + second; }",
    "file2.js": "console.log(add(1 + 2, 3 + 4));"
};
var result = await minify(code);
console.log(result.code);
// function add(d,n){return d+n}console.log(add(3,7));
```

The `toplevel` option:
```javascript
var code = {
    "file1.js": "function add(first, second) { return first + second; }",
    "file2.js": "console.log(add(1 + 2, 3 + 4));"
};
var options = { toplevel: true };
var result = await minify(code, options);
console.log(result.code);
// console.log(3+7);
```

The `nameCache` option:
```javascript
var options = {
    mangle: {
        toplevel: true,
    },
    nameCache: {}
};
var result1 = await minify({
    "file1.js": "function add(first, second) { return first + second; }"
}, options);
var result2 = await minify({
    "file2.js": "console.log(add(1 + 2, 3 + 4));"
}, options);
console.log(result1.code);
// function n(n,r){return n+r}
console.log(result2.code);
// console.log(n(3,7));
```

You may persist the name cache to the file system in the following way:
```javascript
var cacheFileName = "/tmp/cache.json";
var options = {
    mangle: {
        properties: true,
    },
    nameCache: JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(cacheFileName, "utf8"))
};
fs.writeFileSync("part1.js", await minify({
    "file1.js": fs.readFileSync("file1.js", "utf8"),
    "file2.js": fs.readFileSync("file2.js", "utf8")
}, options).code, "utf8");
fs.writeFileSync("part2.js", await minify({
    "file3.js": fs.readFileSync("file3.js", "utf8"),
    "file4.js": fs.readFileSync("file4.js", "utf8")
}, options).code, "utf8");
fs.writeFileSync(cacheFileName, JSON.stringify(options.nameCache), "utf8");
```

An example of a combination of `minify()` options:
```javascript
var code = {
    "file1.js": "function add(first, second) { return first + second; }",
    "file2.js": "console.log(add(1 + 2, 3 + 4));"
};
var options = {
    toplevel: true,
    compress: {
        global_defs: {
            "@console.log": "alert"
        },
        passes: 2
    },
    format: {
        preamble: "/* minified */"
    }
};
var result = await minify(code, options);
console.log(result.code);
// /* minified */
// alert(10);"
```

An error example:
```javascript
try {
    const result = await minify({"foo.js" : "if (0) else console.log(1);"});
    // Do something with result
} catch (error) {
    const { message, filename, line, col, pos } = error;
    // Do something with error
}
```

## Minify options

- `ecma` (default `undefined`) - pass `5`, `2015`, `2016`, etc to override
  `compress` and `format`'s `ecma` options.

- `enclose` (default `false`) - pass `true`, or a string in the format
  of `"args[:values]"`, where `args` and `values` are comma-separated
  argument names and values, respectively, to embed the output in a big
  function with the configurable arguments and values.

- `parse` (default `{}`) — pass an object if you wish to specify some
  additional [parse options](#parse-options).

- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.
  Pass an object to specify custom [compress options](#compress-options).

- `mangle` (default `true`) — pass `false` to skip mangling names, or pass
  an object to specify [mangle options](#mangle-options) (see below).

  - `mangle.properties` (default `false`) — a subcategory of the mangle option.
    Pass an object to specify custom [mangle property options](#mangle-properties-options).

- `module` (default `false`) — Use when minifying an ES6 module. "use strict"
  is implied and names can be mangled on the top scope. If `compress` or
  `mangle` is enabled then the `toplevel` option will be enabled.

- `format` or `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify
  additional [format options](#format-options).  The defaults are optimized
  for best compression.

- `sourceMap` (default `false`) - pass an object if you wish to specify
  [source map options](#source-map-options).

- `toplevel` (default `false`) - set to `true` if you wish to enable top level
  variable and function name mangling and to drop unused variables and functions.

- `nameCache` (default `null`) - pass an empty object `{}` or a previously
  used `nameCache` object if you wish to cache mangled variable and
  property names across multiple invocations of `minify()`. Note: this is
  a read/write property. `minify()` will read the name cache state of this
  object and update it during minification so that it may be
  reused or externally persisted by the user.

- `ie8` (default `false`) - set to `true` to support IE8.

- `keep_classnames` (default: `undefined`) - pass `true` to prevent discarding or mangling
  of class names. Pass a regular expression to only keep class names matching that regex.

- `keep_fnames` (default: `false`) - pass `true` to prevent discarding or mangling
  of function names. Pass a regular expression to only keep function names matching that regex.
  Useful for code relying on `Function.prototype.name`. If the top level minify option
  `keep_classnames` is `undefined` it will be overridden with the value of the top level
  minify option `keep_fnames`.

- `safari10` (default: `false`) - pass `true` to work around Safari 10/11 bugs in
  loop scoping and `await`. See `safari10` options in [`mangle`](#mangle-options)
  and [`format`](#format-options) for details.

## Minify options structure

```javascript
{
    parse: {
        // parse options
    },
    compress: {
        // compress options
    },
    mangle: {
        // mangle options

        properties: {
            // mangle property options
        }
    },
    format: {
        // format options (can also use `output` for backwards compatibility)
    },
    sourceMap: {
        // source map options
    },
    ecma: 5, // specify one of: 5, 2015, 2016, etc.
    enclose: false, // or specify true, or "args:values"
    keep_classnames: false,
    keep_fnames: false,
    ie8: false,
    module: false,
    nameCache: null, // or specify a name cache object
    safari10: false,
    toplevel: false
}
```

### Source map options

To generate a source map:
```javascript
var result = await minify({"file1.js": "var a = function() {};"}, {
    sourceMap: {
        filename: "out.js",
        url: "out.js.map"
    }
});
console.log(result.code); // minified output
console.log(result.map);  // source map
```

Note that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in
`result.map`.  The value passed for `sourceMap.url` is only used to set
`//# sourceMappingURL=out.js.map` in `result.code`. The value of
`filename` is only used to set `file` attribute (see [the spec][sm-spec])
in source map file.

You can set option `sourceMap.url` to be `"inline"` and source map will
be appended to code.

You can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:
```javascript
var result = await minify({"file1.js": "var a = function() {};"}, {
    sourceMap: {
        root: "http://example.com/src",
        url: "out.js.map"
    }
});
```

If you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you
can use `sourceMap.content`:
```javascript
var result = await minify({"compiled.js": "compiled code"}, {
    sourceMap: {
        content: "content from compiled.js.map",
        url: "minified.js.map"
    }
});
// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`
```

If you're using the `X-SourceMap` header instead, you can just omit `sourceMap.url`.

If you happen to need the source map as a raw object, set `sourceMap.asObject` to `true`.

## Parse options

- `bare_returns` (default `false`) -- support top level `return` statements

- `html5_comments` (default `true`)

- `shebang` (default `true`) -- support `#!command` as the first line

- `spidermonkey` (default `false`) -- accept a Spidermonkey (Mozilla) AST

## Compress options

- `defaults` (default: `true`) -- Pass `false` to disable most default
  enabled `compress` transforms. Useful when you only want to enable a few
  `compress` options while disabling the rest.

- `arrows` (default: `true`) -- Class and object literal methods are converted
  will also be converted to arrow expressions if the resultant code is shorter:
  `m(){return x}` becomes `m:()=>x`. To do this to regular ES5 functions which
  don't use `this` or `arguments`, see `unsafe_arrows`.

- `arguments` (default: `false`) -- replace `arguments[index]` with function
  parameter name whenever possible.

- `booleans` (default: `true`) -- various optimizations for boolean context,
  for example `!!a ? b : c → a ? b : c`

- `booleans_as_integers` (default: `false`) -- Turn booleans into 0 and 1, also
  makes comparisons with booleans use `==` and `!=` instead of `===` and `!==`.

- `collapse_vars` (default: `true`) -- Collapse single-use non-constant variables,
  side effects permitting.

- `comparisons` (default: `true`) -- apply certain optimizations to binary nodes,
  e.g. `!(a <= b) → a > b` (only when `unsafe_comps`), attempts to negate binary
  nodes, e.g. `a = !b && !c && !d && !e → a=!(b||c||d||e)` etc.

- `computed_props` (default: `true`) -- Transforms constant computed properties
  into regular ones: `{["computed"]: 1}` is converted to `{computed: 1}`.

- `conditionals` (default: `true`) -- apply optimizations for `if`-s and conditional
  expressions

- `dead_code` (default: `true`) -- remove unreachable code

- `directives` (default: `true`) -- remove redundant or non-standard directives

- `drop_console` (default: `false`) -- Pass `true` to discard calls to
  `console.*` functions. If you wish to drop a specific function call
  such as `console.info` and/or retain side effects from function arguments
  after dropping the function call then use `pure_funcs` instead.

- `drop_debugger` (default: `true`) -- remove `debugger;` statements

- `ecma` (default: `5`) -- Pass `2015` or greater to enable `compress` options that
  will transform ES5 code into smaller ES6+ equivalent forms.

- `evaluate` (default: `true`) -- attempt to evaluate constant expressions

- `expression` (default: `false`) -- Pass `true` to preserve completion values
  from terminal statements without `return`, e.g. in bookmarklets.

- `global_defs` (default: `{}`) -- see [conditional compilation](#conditional-compilation)

- `hoist_funs` (default: `false`) -- hoist function declarations

- `hoist_props` (default: `true`) -- hoist properties from constant object and
  array literals into regular variables subject to a set of constraints. For example:
  `var o={p:1, q:2}; f(o.p, o.q);` is converted to `f(1, 2);`. Note: `hoist_props`
  works best with `mangle` enabled, the `compress` option `passes` set to `2` or higher,
  and the `compress` option `toplevel` enabled.

- `hoist_vars` (default: `false`) -- hoist `var` declarations (this is `false`
  by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general)

- `if_return` (default: `true`) -- optimizations for if/return and if/continue

- `inline` (default: `true`) -- inline calls to function with simple/`return` statement:
  - `false` -- same as `0`
  - `0` -- disabled inlining
  - `1` -- inline simple functions
  - `2` -- inline functions with arguments
  - `3` -- inline functions with arguments and variables
  - `true` -- same as `3`

- `join_vars` (default: `true`) -- join consecutive `var`, `let` and `const` statements

- `keep_classnames` (default: `false`) -- Pass `true` to prevent the compressor from
  discarding class names. Pass a regular expression to only keep class names matching
  that regex. See also: the `keep_classnames` [mangle option](#mangle-options).

- `keep_fargs` (default: `true`) -- Prevents the compressor from discarding unused
  function arguments.  You need this for code which relies on `Function.length`.

- `keep_fnames` (default: `false`) -- Pass `true` to prevent the
  compressor from discarding function names. Pass a regular expression to only keep
  function names matching that regex. Useful for code relying on `Function.prototype.name`.
  See also: the `keep_fnames` [mangle option](#mangle-options).

- `keep_infinity` (default: `false`) -- Pass `true` to prevent `Infinity` from
  being compressed into `1/0`, which may cause performance issues on Chrome.

- `loops` (default: `true`) -- optimizations for `do`, `while` and `for` loops
  when we can statically determine the condition.

- `module` (default `false`) -- Pass `true` when compressing an ES6 module. Strict
  mode is implied and the `toplevel` option as well.

- `negate_iife` (default: `true`) -- negate "Immediately-Called Function Expressions"
  where the return value is discarded, to avoid the parens that the
  code generator would insert.

- `passes` (default: `1`) -- The maximum number of times to run compress.
  In some cases more than one pass leads to further compressed code.  Keep in
  mind more passes will take more time.

- `properties` (default: `true`) -- rewrite property access using the dot notation, for
  example `foo["bar"] → foo.bar`

- `pure_funcs` (default: `null`) -- You can pass an array of names and
  Terser will assume that those functions do not produce side
  effects.  DANGER: will not check if the name is redefined in scope.
  An example case here, for instance `var q = Math.floor(a/b)`.  If
  variable `q` is not used elsewhere, Terser will drop it, but will
  still keep the `Math.floor(a/b)`, not knowing what it does.  You can
  pass `pure_funcs: [ 'Math.floor' ]` to let it know that this
  function won't produce any side effect, in which case the whole
  statement would get discarded.  The current implementation adds some
  overhead (compression will be slower).

- `pure_getters` (default: `"strict"`) -- If you pass `true` for
  this, Terser will assume that object property access
  (e.g. `foo.bar` or `foo["bar"]`) doesn't have any side effects.
  Specify `"strict"` to treat `foo.bar` as side-effect-free only when
  `foo` is certain to not throw, i.e. not `null` or `undefined`.

- `reduce_vars` (default: `true`) -- Improve optimization on variables assigned with and
  used as constant values.

- `reduce_funcs` (default: `true`) -- Inline single-use functions when
  possible. Depends on `reduce_vars` being enabled.  Disabling this option
  sometimes improves performance of the output code.

- `sequences` (default: `true`) -- join consecutive simple statements using the
=======
- `sequences` (default: true) -- join consecutive simple statements using the

  comma operator.  May be set to a positive integer to specify the maximum number
  of consecutive comma sequences that will be generated. If this option is set to
  `true` then the default `sequences` limit is `200`. Set option to `false` or `0`
  to disable. The smallest `sequences` length is `2`. A `sequences` value of `1`
  is grandfathered to be equivalent to `true` and as such means `200`. On rare
  occasions the default sequences limit leads to very slow compress times in which
  case a value of `20` or less is recommended.

- `side_effects` (default: `true`) -- Remove expressions which have no side effects
  and whose results aren't used.

- `drop_debugger` -- remove `debugger;` statements

- `unsafe` (default: false) -- apply "unsafe" transformations (discussion below)

- `unsafe_comps` (default: false) -- Reverse `<` and `<=` to `>` and `>=` to
  allow improved compression. This might be unsafe when an at least one of two
  operands is an object with computed values due the use of methods like `get`,
  or `valueOf`. This could cause change in execution order after operands in the
  comparison are switching. Compression only works if both `comparisons` and

  expressions to arrow functions if the function body does not reference `this`.
  Note: it is not always safe to perform this conversion if code relies on the
  the function having a `prototype`, which arrow functions lack.
  This transform requires that the `ecma` compress option is set to `2015` or greater.

  If `unsafe_methods` is a RegExp then key/value pairs with keys matching the
  RegExp will be converted to concise methods.

  scope is not the global scope. Implies `toplevel`.

- `nth_identifier` (default: an internal mangler that weights based on character
  frequency analysis) -- Pass an object with a `get(n)` function that converts an
  ordinal into the nth most favored (usually shortest) identifier.
  Optionally also provide `reset()`, `sort()`, and `consider(chars, delta)` to
  use character frequency analysis of the source code.

- `builtins` (default: `false`) — Use `true` to allow the mangling of builtin
  DOM properties. Not recommended to override this setting.

- `debug` (default: `false`) — Mangle names with the original name still present.
  Pass an empty string `""` to enable, or a non-empty string to set the debug suffix.

- `keep_quoted` (default: `false`) — How quoting properties (`{"prop": ...}` and `obj["prop"]`) controls what gets mangled.

  `reserved` array.

- `undeclared` (default: `false`) - Mangle those names when they are accessed
  as properties of known top level variables but their declarations are never
  found in input code. May be useful when only minifying parts of a project.

## Format options

These options control the format of Terser's output code. Previously known
as "output options".

- `ascii_only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and
  regexps (affects directives with non-ascii characters becoming invalid)

- `beautify` (default `false`) -- (DEPRECATED) whether to beautify the output.
  When using the legacy `-b` CLI flag, this is set to true by default.

- `braces` (default `false`) -- always insert braces in `if`, `for`,
  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single
  statement.

- `comments` (default `"some"`) -- by default it keeps JSDoc-style comments
  that contain "@license", "@copyright", "@preserve" or start with `!`, pass `true`
  or `"all"` to preserve all comments, `false` to omit comments in the output,
  a regular expression string (e.g. `/^!/`) or a function.

- `ecma` (default `5`) -- set desired EcmaScript standard version for output.
  Set `ecma` to `2015` or greater to emit shorthand object properties - i.e.:
  `{a}` instead of `{a: a}`.  The `ecma` option will only change the output in
  direct control of the beautifier. Non-compatible features in your input will
  still be output as is. For example: an `ecma` setting of `5` will **not**
  convert modern code to ES5.

- `indent_level` (default `4`)

- `indent_start` (default `0`) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces

- `inline_script` (default `true`) -- escape HTML comments and the slash in
  occurrences of `</script>` in strings

- `keep_numbers` (default `false`) -- keep number literals as it was in original code
 (disables optimizations like converting `1000000` into `1e6`)

- `keep_quoted_props` (default `false`) -- when turned on, prevents stripping
  quotes from property names in object literals.

- `max_line_len` (default `false`) -- maximum line length (for minified code)

- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and
  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will
  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing
  licensing information, for example.

- `quote_keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal
  objects

- `quote_style` (default `0`) -- preferred quote style for strings (affects
  quoted property names and directives as well):
  - `0` -- prefers double quotes, switches to single quotes when there are
    more double quotes in the string itself. `0` is best for gzip size.
  - `1` -- always use single quotes
  - `2` -- always use double quotes
  - `3` -- always use the original quotes

- `preserve_annotations` -- (default `false`) -- Preserve [Terser annotations](#annotations) in the output.

- `safari10` (default `false`) -- set this option to `true` to work around
  the [Safari 10/11 await bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=176685).
  See also: the `safari10` [mangle option](#mangle-options).

- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If
  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a
  semicolon, leading to more readable output of minified code (size before
  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).

- `shebang` (default `true`) -- preserve shebang `#!` in preamble (bash scripts)

- `spidermonkey` (default `false`) -- produce a Spidermonkey (Mozilla) AST

- `webkit` (default `false`) -- enable workarounds for WebKit bugs.
  PhantomJS users should set this option to `true`.

- `wrap_iife` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to wrap immediately invoked
  function expressions. See
  [#640](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/640) for more details.

- `wrap_func_args` (default `true`) -- pass `false` if you do not want to wrap
  function expressions that are passed as arguments, in parenthesis. See
  [OptimizeJS](https://github.com/nolanlawson/optimize-js) for more details.

# Miscellaneous

### Keeping copyright notices or other comments

You can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By
default it will keep comments starting with "!" and JSDoc-style comments that
contain "@preserve", "@copyright", "@license" or "@cc_on" (conditional compilation for IE).
You can pass `--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to
keep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments /^!/`
will keep comments like `/*! Copyright Notice */`.

Note, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For
example:
```javascript
function f() {
    /** @preserve Foo Bar */
    function g() {
        // this function is never called
    }
    return something();
}
```

Even though it has "@preserve", the comment will be lost because the inner
function `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is
discarded by the compressor as not referenced.

The safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that
needs to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.

### The `unsafe` `compress` option
=======
- `passes` -- default `1`. Number of times to run compress. Use an
  integer argument larger than 1 to further reduce code size in some cases.
  Note: raising the number of passes will increase uglify compress time.

### The `unsafe` option
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

It enables some transformations that *might* break code logic in certain
contrived cases, but should be fine for most code.  It assumes that standard
built-in ECMAScript functions and classes have not been altered or replaced.
You might want to try it on your own code; it should reduce the minified size.
Some examples of the optimizations made when this option is enabled:

- `new Array(1, 2, 3)` or `Array(1, 2, 3)` → `[ 1, 2, 3 ]`
- `Array.from([1, 2, 3])` → `[1, 2, 3]`
- `new Object()` → `{}`
- `String(exp)` or `exp.toString()` → `"" + exp`
- `new Object/RegExp/Function/Error/Array (...)` → we discard the `new`
<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
- `"foo bar".substr(4)` → `"bar"`
=======
- `typeof foo == "undefined"` → `foo === void 0`
- `void 0` → `undefined` (if there is a variable named "undefined" in
  scope; we do it because the variable name will be mangled, typically
  reduced to a single character)
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

### Conditional compilation

You can use the `--define` (`-d`) switch in order to declare global
variables that Terser will assume to be constants (unless defined in
scope).  For example if you pass `--define DEBUG=false` then, coupled with
dead code removal Terser will discard the following from the output:
```javascript
if (DEBUG) {
	console.log("debug stuff");
}
```

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
You can specify nested constants in the form of `--define env.DEBUG=false`.
=======
UglifyJS will warn about the condition being always false and about dropping
unreachable code; for now there is no option to turn off only this specific
warning, you can pass `warnings=false` to turn off *all* warnings.
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

Another way of doing that is to declare your globals as constants in a
separate file and include it into the build.  For example you can have a
`build/defines.js` file with the following:
```javascript
const DEBUG = false;
const PRODUCTION = true;
// Alternative for environments that don't support `const`
/** @const */ var STAGING = false;
// etc.
```

and build your code like this:

    terser build/defines.js js/foo.js js/bar.js... -c

Terser will notice the constants and, since they cannot be altered, it
will evaluate references to them to the value itself and drop unreachable
code as usual.  The build will contain the `const` declarations if you use
them. If you are targeting < ES6 environments, use `/** @const */ var`.

<a name="codegen-options"></a>

#### Conditional compilation, API
You can also use conditional compilation via the programmatic API. With the difference that the
property name is `global_defs` and is a compressor property:

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
```javascript
var result = await minify(fs.readFileSync("input.js", "utf8"), {
=======
```js
uglifyJS.minify([ "input.js"], {
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
    compress: {
        dead_code: true,
        global_defs: {
            DEBUG: false
        }
    }
});
```

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
To replace an identifier with an arbitrary non-constant expression it is
necessary to prefix the `global_defs` key with `"@"` to instruct Terser
to parse the value as an expression:
```javascript
await minify("alert('hello');", {
    compress: {
        global_defs: {
            "@alert": "console.log"
        }
    }
}).code;
// returns: 'console.log("hello");'
```

Otherwise it would be replaced as string literal:
```javascript
await minify("alert('hello');", {
    compress: {
        global_defs: {
            "alert": "console.log"
        }
    }
}).code;
// returns: '"console.log"("hello");'
```

### Annotations

Annotations in Terser are a way to tell it to treat a certain function call differently. The following annotations are available:

 * `/*@__INLINE__*/` - forces a function to be inlined somewhere.
 * `/*@__NOINLINE__*/` - Makes sure the called function is not inlined into the call site.
 * `/*@__PURE__*/` - Marks a function call as pure. That means, it can safely be dropped.

You can use either a `@` sign at the start, or a `#`.

Here are some examples on how to use them:

```javascript
/*@__INLINE__*/
function_always_inlined_here()

/*#__NOINLINE__*/
function_cant_be_inlined_into_here()

const x = /*#__PURE__*/i_am_dropped_if_x_is_not_used()
```

## Beautifier options

The code generator tries to output shortest code possible by default.  In
case you want beautified output, pass `--beautify` (`-b`).  Optionally you
can pass additional arguments that control the code output:

- `beautify` (default `true`) -- whether to actually beautify the output.
  Passing `-b` will set this to true, but you might need to pass `-b` even
  when you want to generate minified code, in order to specify additional
  arguments, so you can use `-b beautify=false` to override it.
- `indent-level` (default 4)
- `indent-start` (default 0) -- prefix all lines by that many spaces
- `quote-keys` (default `false`) -- pass `true` to quote all keys in literal
  objects
- `space-colon` (default `true`) -- insert a space after the colon signs
- `ascii-only` (default `false`) -- escape Unicode characters in strings and
  regexps (affects directives with non-ascii characters becoming invalid)
- `inline-script` (default `false`) -- escape the slash in occurrences of
  `</script` in strings
- `width` (default 80) -- only takes effect when beautification is on, this
  specifies an (orientative) line width that the beautifier will try to
  obey.  It refers to the width of the line text (excluding indentation).
  It doesn't work very well currently, but it does make the code generated
  by UglifyJS more readable.
- `max-line-len` (default 32000) -- maximum line length (for uglified code)
- `bracketize` (default `false`) -- always insert brackets in `if`, `for`,
  `do`, `while` or `with` statements, even if their body is a single
  statement.
- `semicolons` (default `true`) -- separate statements with semicolons.  If
  you pass `false` then whenever possible we will use a newline instead of a
  semicolon, leading to more readable output of uglified code (size before
  gzip could be smaller; size after gzip insignificantly larger).
- `preamble` (default `null`) -- when passed it must be a string and
  it will be prepended to the output literally.  The source map will
  adjust for this text.  Can be used to insert a comment containing
  licensing information, for example.
- `quote_style` (default `0`) -- preferred quote style for strings (affects
  quoted property names and directives as well):
  - `0` -- prefers double quotes, switches to single quotes when there are
    more double quotes in the string itself.
  - `1` -- always use single quotes
  - `2` -- always use double quotes
  - `3` -- always use the original quotes
- `keep_quoted_props` (default `false`) -- when turned on, prevents stripping
  quotes from property names in object literals.

### Keeping copyright notices or other comments

You can pass `--comments` to retain certain comments in the output.  By
default it will keep JSDoc-style comments that contain "@preserve",
"@license" or "@cc_on" (conditional compilation for IE).  You can pass
`--comments all` to keep all the comments, or a valid JavaScript regexp to
keep only comments that match this regexp.  For example `--comments
'/foo|bar/'` will keep only comments that contain "foo" or "bar".

Note, however, that there might be situations where comments are lost.  For
example:
```javascript
function f() {
	/** @preserve Foo Bar */
	function g() {
	  // this function is never called
	}
	return something();
}
```

Even though it has "@preserve", the comment will be lost because the inner
function `g` (which is the AST node to which the comment is attached to) is
discarded by the compressor as not referenced.

The safest comments where to place copyright information (or other info that
needs to be kept in the output) are comments attached to toplevel nodes.

## Support for the SpiderMonkey AST

UglifyJS2 has its own abstract syntax tree format; for
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
[practical reasons](http://lisperator.net/blog/uglifyjs-why-not-switching-to-spidermonkey-ast/)
we can't easily change to using the SpiderMonkey AST internally.  However,
Terser now has a converter which can import a SpiderMonkey AST.

For example [Acorn][acorn] is a super-fast parser that produces a
SpiderMonkey AST.  It has a small CLI utility that parses one file and dumps
the AST in JSON on the standard output.  To use Terser to mangle and
compress that:

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
    acorn file.js | terser -p spidermonkey -m -c

The `-p spidermonkey` option tells Terser that all input files are not
=======
    acorn file.js | uglifyjs --spidermonkey -m -c

The `--spidermonkey` option tells UglifyJS that all input files are not
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md
JavaScript, but JS code described in SpiderMonkey AST in JSON.  Therefore we
don't use our own parser in this case, but just transform that AST into our
internal AST.

`spidermonkey` is also available in `minify` as `parse` and `format` options to
accept and/or produce a spidermonkey AST.

### Use Acorn for parsing

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
More for fun, I added the `-p acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all
the parsing.  If you pass this option, Terser will `require("acorn")`.
=======
More for fun, I added the `--acorn` option which will use Acorn to do all
the parsing.  If you pass this option, UglifyJS will `require("acorn")`.
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

Acorn is really fast (e.g. 250ms instead of 380ms on some 650K code), but
converting the SpiderMonkey tree that Acorn produces takes another 150ms so
in total it's a bit more than just using Terser's own parser.

### Using UglifyJS to transform SpiderMonkey AST

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
### Terser Fast Minify Mode

It's not well known, but whitespace removal and symbol mangling accounts
for 95% of the size reduction in minified code for most JavaScript - not
elaborate code transforms. One can simply disable `compress` to speed up
Terser builds by 3 to 4 times.

| d3.js | size | gzip size | time (s) |
|   --- | ---: |      ---: |     ---: |
| original                                    | 451,131 | 108,733 |     - |
| terser@3.7.5 mangle=false, compress=false   | 316,600 |  85,245 |  0.82 |
| terser@3.7.5 mangle=true, compress=false    | 220,216 |  72,730 |  1.45 |
| terser@3.7.5 mangle=true, compress=true     | 212,046 |  70,954 |  5.87 |
| babili@0.1.4                                | 210,713 |  72,140 | 12.64 |
| babel-minify@0.4.3                          | 210,321 |  72,242 | 48.67 |
| babel-minify@0.5.0-alpha.01eac1c3           | 210,421 |  72,238 | 14.17 |

To enable fast minify mode from the CLI use:
```
terser file.js -m
```
To enable fast minify mode with the API use:
```js
await minify(code, { compress: false, mangle: true });
=======
Now you can use UglifyJS as any other intermediate tool for transforming
JavaScript ASTs in SpiderMonkey format.

Example:

```javascript
function uglify(ast, options, mangle) {
  // Conversion from SpiderMonkey AST to internal format
  var uAST = UglifyJS.AST_Node.from_mozilla_ast(ast);

  // Compression
  uAST.figure_out_scope();
  uAST = uAST.transform(UglifyJS.Compressor(options));

  // Mangling (optional)
  if (mangle) {
    uAST.figure_out_scope();
    uAST.compute_char_frequency();
    uAST.mangle_names();
  }

  // Back-conversion to SpiderMonkey AST
  return uAST.to_mozilla_ast();
}

```

for details.

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
Various `compress` transforms that simplify, rearrange, inline and remove code
are known to have an adverse effect on debugging with source maps. This is
expected as code is optimized and mappings are often simply not possible as
some code no longer exists. For highest fidelity in source map debugging
disable the `compress` option and just use `mangle`.
=======
API Reference
-------------
>>>>>>> parent of 8dcfa382 (idk what happends):node_modules/uglify-js/README.md

Assuming installation via NPM, you can load UglifyJS in your application
like this:
```javascript
var UglifyJS = require("uglify-js");
```

It exports a lot of names, but I'll discuss here the basics that are needed
for parsing, mangling and compressing a piece of code.  The sequence is (1)
parse, (2) compress, (3) mangle, (4) generate output code.

<<<<<<< HEAD:node_modules/terser/README.md
- `.toString()` and `.valueOf()` don't have side effects, and for built-in
  objects they have not been overridden.
- `undefined`, `NaN` and `Infinity` have not been externally redefined.
- `arguments.callee`, `arguments.caller` and `Function.prototype.caller` are not used.
- The code doesn't expect the contents of `Function.prototype.toString()` or
  `Error.prototype.stack` to be anything in particular.
- Getting and setting properties on a plain object does not cause other side effects
  (using `.watch()` or `Proxy`).
- Object properties can be added, removed and modified (not prevented with
  `Object.defineProperty()`, `Object.defineProperties()`, `Object.freeze()`,
  `Object.preventExtensions()` or `Object.seal()`).
- `document.all` is not `== null`
- Assigning properties to a class doesn't have side effects and does not throw.

### Build Tools and Adaptors using Terser

### Replacing `uglify-es` with `terser` in a project using `yarn`

A number of JS bundlers and uglify wrappers are still using buggy versions
of `uglify-es` and have not yet upgraded to `terser`. If you are using `yarn`
you can add the following alias to your project's `package.json` file:

```js
  "resolutions": {
    "uglify-es": "npm:terser"
  }
```

to use `terser` instead of `uglify-es` in all deeply nested dependencies
without changing any code.

Note: for this change to take effect you must run the following commands
to remove the existing `yarn` lock file and reinstall all packages:

```
$ rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
$ yarn
```

<!-- API_REFERENCE:END -->

# Reporting issues

In the terser CLI we use [source-map-support](https://npmjs.com/source-map-support) to produce good error stacks. In your own app, you're expected to enable source-map-support (read their docs) to have nice stack traces that will help you write good issues.

## Obtaining the source code given to Terser

Because users often don't control the call to `await minify()` or its arguments, Terser provides a `TERSER_DEBUG_DIR` environment variable to make terser output some debug logs. If you're using a bundler or a project that includes a bundler and are not sure what went wrong with your code, pass that variable like so:

```
$ TERSER_DEBUG_DIR=/path/to/logs command-that-uses-terser
$ ls /path/to/logs
terser-debug-123456.log
```

If you're not sure how to set an environment variable on your shell (the above example works in bash), you can try using cross-env:

```
> npx cross-env TERSER_DEBUG_DIR=/path/to/logs command-that-uses-terser
```

### The simple way

There's a single toplevel function which combines all the steps.  If you
don't need additional customization, you might want to go with `minify`.
Example:
```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify("/path/to/file.js");
console.log(result.code); // minified output
// if you need to pass code instead of file name
var result = UglifyJS.minify("var b = function () {};", {fromString: true});
```

You can also compress multiple files:
```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify([ "file1.js", "file2.js", "file3.js" ]);
console.log(result.code);
```

To generate a source map:
```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify([ "file1.js", "file2.js", "file3.js" ], {
	outSourceMap: "out.js.map"
});
console.log(result.code); // minified output
console.log(result.map);
```

To generate a source map with the fromString option, you can also use an object:
```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify({"file1.js": "var a = function () {};"}, {
  outSourceMap: "out.js.map",
  outFileName: "out.js",
  fromString: true
});
```

Note that the source map is not saved in a file, it's just returned in
`result.map`.  The value passed for `outSourceMap` is only used to set
`//# sourceMappingURL=out.js.map` in `result.code`. The value of
`outFileName` is only used to set `file` attribute in source map file.

The `file` attribute in the source map (see [the spec][sm-spec]) will
use `outFileName` firstly, if it's falsy, then will be deduced from
`outSourceMap` (by removing `'.map'`).

You can set option `sourceMapInline` to be `true` and source map will
be appended to code.

You can also specify sourceRoot property to be included in source map:
```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify([ "file1.js", "file2.js", "file3.js" ], {
	outSourceMap: "out.js.map",
	sourceRoot: "http://example.com/src"
});
```

If you're compressing compiled JavaScript and have a source map for it, you
can use the `inSourceMap` argument:
```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify("compiled.js", {
	inSourceMap: "compiled.js.map",
	outSourceMap: "minified.js.map"
});
// same as before, it returns `code` and `map`
```

If your input source map is not in a file, you can pass it in as an object
using the `inSourceMap` argument:

```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify("compiled.js", {
	inSourceMap: JSON.parse(my_source_map_string),
	outSourceMap: "minified.js.map"
});
```

The `inSourceMap` is only used if you also request `outSourceMap` (it makes
no sense otherwise).

To set the source map url, use the `sourceMapUrl` option.
If you're using the X-SourceMap header instead, you can just set the `sourceMapUrl` option to false.
Defaults to outSourceMap:

```javascript
var result = UglifyJS.minify([ "file1.js" ], {
  outSourceMap: "out.js.map",
  sourceMapUrl: "localhost/out.js.map"
});
```

Other options:

- `warnings` (default `false`) — pass `true` to display compressor warnings.

- `fromString` (default `false`) — if you pass `true` then you can pass
  JavaScript source code, rather than file names.

- `mangle` (default `true`) — pass `false` to skip mangling names, or pass
  an object to specify mangling options (see below).

- `mangleProperties` (default `false`) — pass an object to specify custom
  mangle property options.

- `output` (default `null`) — pass an object if you wish to specify
  additional [output options][codegen].  The defaults are optimized
  for best compression.

- `compress` (default `{}`) — pass `false` to skip compressing entirely.
  Pass an object to specify custom [compressor options][compressor].

- `parse` (default {}) — pass an object if you wish to specify some
  additional [parser options][parser]. (not all options available... see below)

##### mangle

 - `except` - pass an array of identifiers that should be excluded from mangling

 - `toplevel` — mangle names declared in the toplevel scope (disabled by
  default).

 - `eval` — mangle names visible in scopes where eval or with are used
  (disabled by default).

 - `keep_fnames` -- default `false`.  Pass `true` to not mangle
  function names.  Useful for code relying on `Function.prototype.name`.
  See also: the `keep_fnames` [compress option](#compressor-options).

  Examples:

  ```javascript
  //tst.js
  var globalVar;
  function funcName(firstLongName, anotherLongName)
  {
    var myVariable = firstLongName +  anotherLongName;
  }

  UglifyJS.minify("tst.js").code;
  // 'function funcName(a,n){}var globalVar;'

  UglifyJS.minify("tst.js", { mangle: { except: ['firstLongName'] } }).code;
  // 'function funcName(firstLongName,a){}var globalVar;'

  UglifyJS.minify("tst.js", { mangle: { toplevel: true } }).code;
  // 'function n(n,a){}var a;'
  ```

##### mangleProperties options

 - `regex` — Pass a RegExp to only mangle certain names (maps to the `--mangle-regex` CLI arguments option)
 - `ignore_quoted` – Only mangle unquoted property names (maps to the `--mangle-props 2` CLI arguments option)
 - `debug` – Mangle names with the original name still present (maps to the `--mangle-props-debug` CLI arguments option). Defaults to `false`. Pass an empty string to enable, or a non-empty string to set the suffix.

We could add more options to `UglifyJS.minify` — if you need additional
functionality please suggest!

### The hard way

Following there's more detailed API info, in case the `minify` function is
too simple for your needs.

#### The parser
```javascript
var toplevel_ast = UglifyJS.parse(code, options);
```

`options` is optional and if present it must be an object.  The following
properties are available:

- `strict` — disable automatic semicolon insertion and support for trailing
  comma in arrays and objects
- `bare_returns` — Allow return outside of functions. (maps to the
  `--bare-returns` CLI arguments option and available to `minify` `parse`
  other options object)
- `filename` — the name of the file where this code is coming from
- `toplevel` — a `toplevel` node (as returned by a previous invocation of
  `parse`)

The last two options are useful when you'd like to minify multiple files and
get a single file as the output and a proper source map.  Our CLI tool does
something like this:
```javascript
var toplevel = null;
files.forEach(function(file){
	var code = fs.readFileSync(file, "utf8");
	toplevel = UglifyJS.parse(code, {
		filename: file,
		toplevel: toplevel
	});
});
```

After this, we have in `toplevel` a big AST containing all our files, with
each token having proper information about where it came from.

#### Scope information

UglifyJS contains a scope analyzer that you need to call manually before
compressing or mangling.  Basically it augments various nodes in the AST
with information about where is a name defined, how many times is a name
referenced, if it is a global or not, if a function is using `eval` or the
`with` statement etc.  I will discuss this some place else, for now what's
important to know is that you need to call the following before doing
anything with the tree:
```javascript
toplevel.figure_out_scope()
```

#### Compression

Like this:
```javascript
var compressor = UglifyJS.Compressor(options);
var compressed_ast = toplevel.transform(compressor);
```

The `options` can be missing.  Available options are discussed above in
“Compressor options”.  Defaults should lead to best compression in most
scripts.

The compressor is destructive, so don't rely that `toplevel` remains the
original tree.

#### Mangling

After compression it is a good idea to call again `figure_out_scope` (since
the compressor might drop unused variables / unreachable code and this might
change the number of identifiers or their position).  Optionally, you can
call a trick that helps after Gzip (counting character frequency in
non-mangleable words).  Example:
```javascript
compressed_ast.figure_out_scope();
compressed_ast.compute_char_frequency();
compressed_ast.mangle_names();
```

#### Generating output

AST nodes have a `print` method that takes an output stream.  Essentially,
to generate code you do this:
```javascript
var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream(options);
compressed_ast.print(stream);
var code = stream.toString(); // this is your minified code
```

or, for a shortcut you can do:
```javascript
var code = compressed_ast.print_to_string(options);
```

As usual, `options` is optional.  The output stream accepts a lot of options,
most of them documented above in section “Beautifier options”.  The two
which we care about here are `source_map` and `comments`.

#### Keeping comments in the output

In order to keep certain comments in the output you need to pass the
`comments` option.  Pass a RegExp (as string starting and closing with `/`
or pass a RegExp object), a boolean or a function.  Stringified options
`all` and `some` can be passed too, where `some` behaves like it's cli
equivalent `--comments` without passing a value. If you pass a RegExp,
only those comments whose body matches the RegExp will be kept.  Note that body
means without the initial `//` or `/*`.  If you pass a function, it will be
called for every comment in the tree and will receive two arguments: the
node that the comment is attached to, and the comment token itself.

The comment token has these properties:

- `type`: "comment1" for single-line comments or "comment2" for multi-line
  comments
- `value`: the comment body
- `pos` and `endpos`: the start/end positions (zero-based indexes) in the
  original code where this comment appears
- `line` and `col`: the line and column where this comment appears in the
  original code
- `file` — the file name of the original file
- `nlb` — true if there was a newline before this comment in the original
  code, or if this comment contains a newline.

Your function should return `true` to keep the comment, or a falsy value
otherwise.

#### Generating a source mapping

You need to pass the `source_map` argument when calling `print`.  It needs
to be a `SourceMap` object (which is a thin wrapper on top of the
[source-map][source-map] library).

Example:
```javascript
var source_map = UglifyJS.SourceMap(source_map_options);
var stream = UglifyJS.OutputStream({
	...
	source_map: source_map
});
compressed_ast.print(stream);

var code = stream.toString();
var map = source_map.toString(); // json output for your source map
```

The `source_map_options` (optional) can contain the following properties:

- `file`: the name of the JavaScript output file that this mapping refers to
- `root`: the `sourceRoot` property (see the [spec][sm-spec])
- `orig`: the "original source map", handy when you compress generated JS
  and want to map the minified output back to the original code where it
  came from.  It can be simply a string in JSON, or a JSON object containing
  the original source map.
